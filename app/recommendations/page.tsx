        If I could only go to one korean spot in my life. It would be this place
        </p>

        Their creamy seafood pane udon is an absolute delight and their wings are done well as any classic crispy korean wing spot. Their bossam are mouth-watering with how the pork belly pairs with their white Kimchi.

        I highly highly recommend this place

        They have a butcher room right in front of the entrance so you know it is fresh meat you are getting at this place. They are great for any beginners since the portion sizes are generous and the appetizers (popcorn chicken and mandu) should suffice while you wait for the meat to cook.

        This is a good value and fresh meat spot but i still recommend the first spot if you have never had korean food
